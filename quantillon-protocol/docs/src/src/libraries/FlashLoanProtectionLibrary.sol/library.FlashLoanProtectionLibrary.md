Library for protecting contracts against flash loan attacks

*This library provides functions to detect and prevent flash loan attacks
by monitoring balance changes during function execution.*

*Flash loan attacks can occur when:
- An attacker borrows a large amount of tokens
- Manipulates protocol state (e.g., governance votes, price oracles)
- Repays the loan in the same transaction
- Profits from the manipulated state*

*Protection mechanism:
- Balance checks before and after function execution
- Validation that balances don't decrease unexpectedly*

**Note:**

## Functions
### validateBalanceChange

Validates that a balance change is within acceptable limits

*This function validates that balances don't decrease beyond acceptable limits.
Currently used by all contract modifiers to prevent flash loan attacks.
A maxDecrease of 0 means no decrease is allowed (strict protection).*

**Notes:**
- Prevents flash loan attacks by validating balance changes

- Validates balance changes are within acceptable limits

- No state changes - pure function

- No events emitted

- No custom errors thrown

- Not applicable - pure function

- Internal function - no access restrictions

- No oracle dependencies


```solidity
function validateBalanceChange(uint256 balanceBefore, uint256 balanceAfter, uint256 maxDecrease)
    internal
    pure
    returns (bool);
```
